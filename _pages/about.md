# About Me

I'm currently pursing my Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yinliang Xu](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/xyl_en/main.htm). 

I'm a member of Energy Management System Laboratory led by Prof. [Hongbin Sun](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/shb.htm), Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University.

My research interests include power system optimization and control, decarbonization of the power system, and the application of data-driven method in power systems.

My CV is [here](../assets/Zehao_Song_CV.pdf).

# Research
The power system is undergoing an evolutionary transition for a more sustainable future under the goal of decarbonization.
My research focuses on the power system operation problem with ever-increasing distributed energy resources (DERs) like
renewable energy resources (RESs), energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs) integration on the demand-side.
## Uncertainty Problem: 
Handle with uncertainty problem associated with RES during power system operation. My current research interest is on distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based approaches.
## Distributed Optimization in Smart Grid: 
Decentralized and distributed operation mode to fully exploit the flexibility and edge-intelligence of numerous DERs and promote demand-side users to participate in demand response (DR).
