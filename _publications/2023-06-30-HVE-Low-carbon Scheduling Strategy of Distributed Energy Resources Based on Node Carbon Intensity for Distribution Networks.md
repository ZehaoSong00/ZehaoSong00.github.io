excerpt: 'The proposition of dual-carbon goal has accelerated the construction of new power systems. High penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy sources (DERs) integrating into the power system pose a great challenge of how to improve the utilization of the flexibility potential provided by these various resources and to reduce the total carbon emission of the system. Consequently, we propose a low-carbon demand response (DR) strategy based on the carbon intensity for distribution networks (DNs), in which the low-carbon operation strategy can be realized by comprising both economic issue and low-carbon issue. First, we analyze the carbon intensity profile of the DN based on the carbon emission flow (CEF) theory. Then, we adjust the main grid power purchasing plan, the generation plan and guide the demand side resources to adjust their energy profile with the reference of carbon intensity. In order to ensure the safe and steady operation of the DN, the power system operation safety constraints are also included in the proposed strategy. Moreover, the numerical tests and comparison with other operation strategies have demonstrated that the proposed strategy can effectively improve the consumption of RES and reduce the branch loss, carbon emission and operation cost of DN.'

Abstract: The proposition of dual-carbon goal has accelerated the construction of new power systems. High penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy sources (DERs) integrating into the power system pose a great challenge of how to improve the utilization of the flexibility potential provided by these various resources and to reduce the total carbon emission of the system. Consequently, we propose a low-carbon demand response (DR) strategy based on the carbon intensity for distribution networks (DNs), in which the low-carbon operation strategy can be realized by comprising both economic issue and low-carbon issue. First, we analyze the carbon intensity profile of the DN based on the carbon emission flow (CEF) theory. Then, we adjust the main grid power purchasing plan, the generation plan and guide the demand side resources to adjust their energy profile with the reference of carbon intensity. In order to ensure the safe and steady operation of the DN, the power system operation safety constraints are also included in the proposed strategy. Moreover, the numerical tests and comparison with other operation strategies have demonstrated that the proposed strategy can effectively improve the consumption of RES and reduce the branch loss, carbon emission and operation cost of DN.
