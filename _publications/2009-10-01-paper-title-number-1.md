Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) has facilitated the development of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading mechanism. An efficient P2P trading market framework is essential to integrate various kinds of DERs into new power systems while ensuring network security constraints (NSCs). This paper proposes a carbon-aware P2P trading market to realize joint energy and reserve trading for prosumers while satisfying NSCs of the distribution network (DN) simultaneously. A geometric series acceleration (GSA) method accelerated algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (C-ADMM) is proposed to solve the distributed P2P trading problem. A data-driven method based on the two-sided distributionally robust chance constraint (TS-DRCC) is adopted to tackle with the uncertainty problem associated with DERs. Numerical tests on the IEEE 15-Bus distribution system and IEEE 141-Bus distribution system verify the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method.
